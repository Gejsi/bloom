# Hati

Example app built to show Fenrir's features:
it shows an email message analysis pipeline.

To run the monolithic code:

```console
$ pnpm full:dev
```

To run the serverless code:

```console
// start the offline gateway
$ pnpm serve
// run the code
$ pnpm less:dev
```

The transpiled code can already be seen in the `output` directory.
